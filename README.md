## Project Overview

Planetrics was created using **Plotly Studio** to visualize NASA's vast catalog of confirmed exoplanets. The app features interactive charts, a searchable data table, and curated scientific insights to make complex astronomical data accessible to everyone.

The app is hosted on **Plotly Cloud**.

## Running the Code

The `get_data.py` script in this repository is used to fetch the latest exoplanet data and create the CSV file required for the app.

### Requirements
* Python 3
* Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

### Editing & Deployment
This application was built entirely within **Plotly Studio**. To edit or modify the original app, one must use the Plotly Studio platform. The CSV file generated by the script can be used to create a new project within Studio.
